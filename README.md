# <WeatherBoard>

## Description

This website can bring you to any city and provide not only current weather but future weather as well. Showing conditions such as; wind, humidity, temp and more. This can help you plan your week and not get caught in the rain! This was made using a third party API called open weather map, JQuary, and more! My motivation to create this was to further my knowledge within linking API's and learned about the process of trouble shooting when a API key doesnt work even though it may seem correctly connected.
